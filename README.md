# Super Mario Bros
This project was my attempt to recreate the original NES game, Super Mario Bros, as a desktop application using libgdx.

# Description
Super Mario Bros is a 2-D side scroller where the player must race against the clock to reach the goal. Along the way, they must also avoid/kill enemies with the help of some power-ups.

Some Key Features:

  - Movement
  
    The player will be able to move left/right and have the ability to jump.
  - Attacking
  
    The player will be able to "attack" enemies by jumping on their heads and through the use of some power-ups (eventually).
  - Collecting Power-ups
  
    Players will be able to collect various power-ups (although only one is implemented), each with their own unique effect, to aid them on     every level.
