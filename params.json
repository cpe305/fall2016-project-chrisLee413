Along the way, they must also avoid/kill enemies with the help of some power-ups.\r\n\r\nSome Key Features:\r\n\r\n  - Movement\r\n  \r\n    The player will be able to move left/right and have the ability to jump.\r\n  - Attacking\r\n  \r\n    The player will be able to \"attack\" enemies by jumping on their heads and through the use of some power-ups (eventually).\r\n  - Collecting Power-ups\r\n  \r\n    Players will be able to collect various power-ups (although only one is implemented), each with their own unique effect, to aid them on     every level.\r\n    \r\n# Relevant Design Patterns\r\n  - State Pattern\r\n  \r\n    - Mario\r\n    \r\n    - Turtle\r\n  - Strategy Pattern\r\n  \r\n    - Item\r\n    \r\n    - Enemy\r\n    \r\n    - InteractiveTileObject\r\n    \r\n# Contact\r\nclee186@calpoly.edu\r\n",
